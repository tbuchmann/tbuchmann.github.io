Abstract
=====

Class diagrams are at the core of object oriented modeling. They are the foundation of model-driven software engineering and backed up by a wide range of supporting tools. In most cases, source code may be generated from class diagrams which results in increasing productivity of developers. In this paper we present an approach that allows the automatic conversion of hand-drawn sketches of class diagrams into corresponding UML models and thus can help to speed up the development process significantly.

Abstract
=====

Bidirectional transformations have been studied in a wide range of application domains. In model-driven software engineering, they are required for roundtrip engineering processes. We present a pragmatic approach to engineering bidirectional model transformations that assists transformation developers by domain-specific languages, frameworks, and code generators and provides for conciseness, expressiveness, and scalability. We also discuss different variants of transformation development processes as well as their advantages and drawbacks.

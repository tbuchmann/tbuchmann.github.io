Abstract
=====

Significant achievements have been made in the design and implementation of languages and tools for graph transformation systems. However, many other competing approaches have been developed for model-driven software development. We present a case study in which we have applied different modeling approaches in the construction of a graphical tool for software process management. We have compared these approaches with respect to the respective levels of abstraction on which models are defined, the language concepts offered, and the implied modeling effort.

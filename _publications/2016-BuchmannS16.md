Abstract
=====

Model-driven software product line engineering is an integrating discipline for which tool support has become available recently. However, existing tools are still immature and have several weaknesses. Among others, limitations in variability, caused by meta model restrictions, and unintended information loss are not addressed. In this paper, we present two conceptual extensions to model-driven product line engineering based on negative variability, being alternative mappings and surrogates. Alternative mappings allow for unconstrained variability, mitigating meta model restrictions by virtually extending the underlying multi-variant domain model. Surrogates prevent unintended information loss during product derivation based on a context-sensitive product analysis, which can be controlled by a declarative OCL-based language. Both extensions have been implemented in FAMILE, a model-driven product line tool that is based on EMF, provides dedicated consistency repair mechanisms, and completely automates application engineering. The added value of alternative mappings and surrogates is demonstrated by a running example.

Abstract
=====

Model-driven software development intends to reduce development effort by generating code from high-level models. However, models for non-trivial problems are still large and require sophisticated support for modeling in the large. Experiences from our current project, dedicated to a model-driven modular software configuration management (SCM) system, confirm this claim. This paper presents a stand-alone package diagram editor that has been developed using Fujaba and discusses its integration into the Fujaba tool suite.

Abstract
=====

Model Transformations are a key element of Model-Driven Software Engineering. As soon as variability is involved, transformations become increasingly complicated. The lack of support for variability in model transformations impairs the acceptance of approaches to organized reuse such as software product lines. In this position paper, the general problem of multi-variant model transformations is formulated for MOF-based, XMI-serialized models. A simplistic case study is presented to specify the input and the expected output of such a transformation. Furthermore, requirements for tool support are defined, including a standardized representation of both multi-variant model instances and variability information, as well as an execution specification for multi-variant transformations. A literature review reveals that the problem is weakly identified and often solved using ad-hoc solutions; there exists no tool providing a general solution to the proposed problem statement. The observations presented here may serve for the future development of standards and tools.

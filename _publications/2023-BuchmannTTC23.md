Abstract
=====

Container orchestration is a critical component in the realm of DevOps practices, enabling the efficient management of containers within complex application architectures. However, a significant challenge arises in reconciling the disparity between high-level graphical representations of container orchestration models and the concrete configuration files essential for container orchestration tools. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel bidirectional and asymmetric transformation approach, facilitating the translation from container orchestrations to MiniYAML through the utilization of BXtendDSL, a hybrid bidirectional and incremental model-to-model transformation language capable of supporting both declarative and imperative specification of model transformations. The paper presents the proposed solution, outlining the transformation rules, and assesses the effectiveness of the approach using benchmark criteria.

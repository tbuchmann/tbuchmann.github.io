Abstract
=====

Model-driven software engineering aims at increasing productivity by replacing conventional programming with the development of high-level models. Over the years, UML has been established as a standard modeling language which is supported by a large number of tools. Unfortunately, many of these tools primarily focus on graphical editing of diagrams and lack sophisticated support for code generation. The Valkyrie environment addresses this shortcoming. While Valkyrie supports requirements elicitation with use case and activity diagrams, its main emphasis lies on analysis and design, which are based on package diagrams, class diagrams, statecharts, and the textual UML Action Language (UAL). Modeling-in-the-large is supported by package diagrams. Packages are refined into class diagrams. For some class, a statechart may be defined as a protocol state machine. Finally, a method of a class is defined by an activity diagram or a textual program written in UAL. From these artefacts, Valkyrie may generate fully executable code from a platform independent model. Valkyrie is built not only for, but also with model-driven software engineering. It is based on the Eclipse UML2 metamodel and makes use of several frameworks and generators to reduce implementation effort. This paper reports on the current state of Valkyrie, which is still under development.

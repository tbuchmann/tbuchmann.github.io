Abstract
=====

Model-driven software engineering aims at increasing productivity by replacing conventional programming with the development of high-level executable models. However, current technology focuses on structural models, while behavioral modeling is still neglected. The transformation engine ModGraph intends to fill this gap. ModGraph complements the Eclipse Modeling Framework with graphical transformation rules from which executable code is generated. An operation defined in an Ecore model is specified by a model transformation rule which is compiled into a Java method calling EMF operations. In this way, ModGraph complements the capabilities of EMF which would compile operations into empty Java methods. The net result is an environment which provides comprehensive support for executable models.

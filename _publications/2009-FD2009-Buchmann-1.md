Abstract
=====

In the past, several approaches have been made to combine feature models and domain models on the level of class diagrams. But the model-driven development approach also covers models that describe the behavior of a software system. In this paper we present a mapping of feature models and configurations to executable model elements which is one step towards an overall model driven process for product line engineering. We present a tool called MODPLFeaturePlugin, which allows the user to establish a mapping between a distinct feature model and the domain model of the software system realized in Fujaba and also to create code for specific product configurations.

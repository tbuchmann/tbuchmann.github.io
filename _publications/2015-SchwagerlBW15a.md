Abstract
=====

Software Product Line Engineering promises to increase the productivity of software development. In the literature, a plan-driven process has been established that is divided up into domain and application engineering. We argue that the strictly sequential order of its process activities implies several disadvantages such as increased complexity, late customer feedback, and duplicate maintenance. SuperMod is a novel model-driven tool based upon a filtered editing model oriented towards version control. The tool provides integrated support for domain and application engineering, offering an iterative and incremental style of development. In this paper, we apply SuperMod to a well-known case study, the Home Automation System product line. We learn that the tool supports a broad variety of iterative and incremental development processes, ranging from phase-structured to feature-driven. Furthermore, it can mitigate the disadvantages of the traditional software product line development process.

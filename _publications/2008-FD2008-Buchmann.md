Abstract
=====

Model-driven software development intends to reduce development effort by generating code from high-level models. However, models for non-trivial problems are still large and require sophisticated support for modeling in the large. Experiences from a recently launched project dedicated to a model-driven modular SCM system confirm this claim. This paper investigates modeling in the large support provided by the object-oriented CASE tool Fujaba and discusses potential extensions of Fujaba based on UML package diagrams.

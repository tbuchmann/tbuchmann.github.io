Abstract
=====

Triple graph grammars have been used to specify consistency maintenance between inter-dependent and evolving models at a high level of abstraction. On a lower level, consistency maintenance may be specified by a triple graph transformation system, which takes care of all operational details required for executing consistency maintenance operations. This paper presents a case study from software configuration management in which we decided to hand-craft a triple graph transformation system rather than to generate it from a triple graph grammar. The case study demonstrates some limitations concerning the kinds of consistency maintenance problems which can be handled by triple graph grammars.

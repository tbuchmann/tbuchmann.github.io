Abstract
=====

Model-driven engineering is a wide-spread paradigm in modern software engineering. During the last couple of years, many tools and languages have been developed, which are especially designed for model transformations --- a discipline which is needed in many model-driven engineering approaches. While most of the existing model-to-model tools and languages are tailored towards batch transformations for specific model instances, they lack support for generic transformation problems, where the metamodel is unknown beforehand. In this paper we present a two-step meta-code generation approach that derives a metamodel-specific model-to-model transformation from a model-to-text transformation. The approach has been successfully applied to the problem of product derivation in model-driven software product lines.

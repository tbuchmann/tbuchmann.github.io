Abstract
=====

The Fujaba tool suite supports the development of models and the generation of code, but it does not cover the development of tools with graphical user interfaces. In this paper, we report on ongoing work in constructing Fujaba-based graphical editors with GEF, an Eclipse-based framework for constructing graphical editors.

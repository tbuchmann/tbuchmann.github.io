Abstract
=====

This paper presents a solution to the  Case at TTC 2023 using BXtendDSL. BXtendDSL is declarative language for bidirectional and incremental model transformations, built on top of an imperative framework. The transformation developer may extend the transformation on the imperative layer whenever the expressive power of the declarative language is not enough to tackle the transformation problem at hand. Thus, BXtendDSL provides a flexible and powerful tool for all possible transformation problems.

Abstract
=====

Model-driven development is a well-known practice in modernsoftware engineering. Many tools exist which allow developers to build software in a model-based or even model-driven way, but they do not provide dedicated support for software product line development. Only recently some approaches combined model-driven engineering and software product line engineering. In this paper we present an approach that allows for combining feature models and Ecore-based domain models and provides extensive support to keep the mapping between the involved models consistent. Our key contribution is a declarative textual language which allows to phrase domain-specific consistency constraints which are preserved during the configuration process in order to ensure context-sensitive syntactical correctness of derived domain models.

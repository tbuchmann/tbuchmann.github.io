Abstract
=====

Model transformations are the core essence of model-driven software development. Over the years, languages and techniques for unidirectional batch transformations have become mature and are used frequently. However, some transformation problems rather demand for bidirectional and incremental transformations. Unfortunately, available model transformation languages support this kind of transformations only to a limited extent. In this paper, we present a solution for bidirectional and incremental model transformations using a handcrafted triple graph transformation system. As a real world use case, we show the feasibility of our approach in the context of model and code synchronization.

Abstract
=====

Model-driven development relies on model-transformation languages to describe mappings between different metamodels and as such facilitate a model-first workflow. These languages and accompanying tools have matured a lot over the past years. However, the more recent developments BXtend and BXtendDSL lack some features like an integrated expression language which would greatly improve the usability. In this paper, we present the flexible expression language NICE, which aims to solve the aforementioned problem in a modular, reusable, and adaptable way, while being fast and easy to use.

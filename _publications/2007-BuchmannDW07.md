Abstract
=====

In this paper we describe and evaluate our combination of the Fujaba CASE-Tool with the Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) of the Eclipse IDE. We created an operational model with Fujaba and used it as input for a GMF editor generationprocess. This allows us to introduce a new approach for generating fully operational models including graphical editors for model representation and transformation. By making our developement process explicit this paper acts as a guide for applying this approach to other projects as well.

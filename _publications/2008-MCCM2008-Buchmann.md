Abstract
=====

Software configuration management (SCM) is the discipline of controlling the evolution of large and complex software systems. Many tools and systems for SCM have been developed which are based on a variety of different version models. Usually, an SCM application is a single software system whose underlying architecture is implicitly defined by its implementation. MOD2-SCM, instead, is a modular and extendable SCM system whose components have been explicitly modeled. Each component is defined by a separate model which addresses a specific area of the SCM domain. These components are loosely coupled by extending a common core model. We describe how the architecture of MOD2-SCM has been designed to support the co-evolution of the various component models. Additionally, we discuss the difficulties we experienced when it comes to the co-evolution of the common core model and the component models.

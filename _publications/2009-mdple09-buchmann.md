Abstract
=====

In the past, several approaches have been made to combine feature models and domain models on the level of class diagrams. But the model-driven development approach also covers models that describe the behavior of a software system. In this paper we will describe a mapping of feature configurations to executable model elements which is one step towards an overall model driven process for product line engineering. We will specify consistency constraints that have to be met to ensure model correctness, and we will discuss the problems that arise during the final model-to-code transformation.

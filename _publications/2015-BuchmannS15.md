Abstract
=====

Model-driven software engineering emphasizes using models as primary development artefacts. In many cases, the static structure of a software system can be automatically generated from static models such as class diagrams. However, hand-written source code is still necessary, either for specifying method bodies or for integrating the generated code with already existing artefacts or frameworks. In this paper, we present a concept and the corresponding technical solution, which allow to lift up hand-written code for method bodies to the model level and tightly integrate it with the Ecore model. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with the help of a concrete use case.

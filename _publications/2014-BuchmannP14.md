Abstract
=====

During the last few years, mobile devices and corresponding applications gain more and more attention. The number of users of mobile devices like phones or tablets has been increasing dramatically. Thus, software engineering for mobile applications becomes more and more important. While development frameworks for such devices provide rich support for sophisticated input mechanisms like gestures, etc., they lack support for graphical editors. In this paper, we present a lightweight framework which fills this gap. As a running example, we present editors for UML class diagrams and activity diagrams which have been built using our framework.

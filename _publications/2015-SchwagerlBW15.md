Abstract
=====

Version control (VC) and Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) are two software engineering disciplines to manage variability in time and variability in space. In this paper, a thorough comparison of VC and SPLE is provided, showing that both disciplines imply a number of desirable properties. As a proof of concept for the combination of VC and SPLE, we present SuperMod, a tool realizes an existing conceptual framework that transfers the iterative VC editing model to SPLE. The tool allows to develop a software product line in a single-version workspace step by step, while variability management is completely automated. It offers familiar version control metaphors such as check-out and commit, and in addition uses the SPLE concepts of feature models and feature configuration the definition of logical variability and to define the logical scope of a change. SuperMod has been implemented in a model-driven way and primarily targets EMF models as software artifacts. We successfully apply the tool to a standard SPLE example.

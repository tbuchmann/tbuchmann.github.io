Abstract
=====

Model-driven software engineering is supported with the help of model transformations. At present, the technology for defining and executing uni-directional batch transformations seems to be well developed, while bi-directional and incremental transformations are more difficult to handle. In this paper, we present a bi-directional and incremental transformation tool for round-trip engineering between class diagrams and Java source code. Our focus lies on the model-driven construction of this tool with the help of a set of model transformation tools. Thus, our work serves as a case study of applying and composing existing model transformation tools.

Abstract
=====

Software configuration management (SCM) is the discipline of controlling the evolution of large and complex software systems. Many tools and systems for SCM have been developed which are based on a variety of different version models. Usually, the underlying version models have been hard-wired into the respective tool or system. In this paper we present MOD2-SCM, a PhD project which is dedicated to a model-driven approach to the development of SCM systems which makes the underlying version model explicit, reduces development effort by replacing coding with creating executable models, and supports reuse by providing a product line for SCM.

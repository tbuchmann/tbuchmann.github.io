Abstract
=====

Fujaba is a powerful tool for model driven development. But when it comes down to the development of graphical user interfaces, developers are still in need of massive manual coding. On the other side, GMF provides a way of generating graphical user interfaces, but it is tightly coupled to an underlying EMF model. In this paper we show a way how to extend Fujaba's code generation to preserve most of Fujaba's modeling and code generation benefits and map the Fujaba model onto a EMF specification.

Abstract
=====

Model-driven development is a well-known practice in modern software engineering. A wide variety of different tools exist, which support model-driven development. Usually, these tools do not provide dedicated support for agile modeling, as they can be used with any development process. In this paper, we present an extension to our UML-based modeling tool Valkyrie which allows free-hand diagram sketching. Thus, it addresses agile modeling as whiteboards and papers can now be replaced with tablet computers or other touch-enabled (hand-held) devices.

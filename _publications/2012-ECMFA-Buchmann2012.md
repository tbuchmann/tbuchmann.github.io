Abstract
=====

Model-driven development is a well-known practice in modern software engineering. Many tools exist which allow developers to build software in a model-driven way. Unfortunately, these tools do not provide dedicated support for the specific needs in software product line processes. Only recently some approaches tried to combine feature modeling and model-driven development. In this paper we present a new approach that allows for the combination of feature models and Ecore based domain models and keeps both models consistent during evolution.

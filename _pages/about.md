I am a Professor for Practical Computer Science at [Hof University](https://www.hof-university.de) since March 2024. Prior to my current employment, I was a Professor for Software Engineering at [Deggendorf Institute for Technology](https://www.th-deg.de/en). Before, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Software Engineering Group](https://www.ai1.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html) lead by [Prof. Dr. Bernhard Westfechtel](https://www.ai1.uni-bayreuth.de/en/team/prof-westfechtel/index.php) at the [University of Bayreuth](https://www.uni-bayreuth.de/en). I received my PhD also in the Software Engineering Group under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Westfechtel. My research interests include Software Engineering in general, Model-driven Software Development, Model Transformations, Software Product Lines, and Domain-specific Languages. 

Prior to my PhD, I have worked in industry as a software developer, as a software project manager in Weig Software GmbH (now [Speed4Trade](https://speed4trade.com)) and as a manager of the software engineering department, leading an international team of developers, in [DESKO GmbH](http://www.desko.de). I graduated with a Diploma degree (Dipl.) in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Bayreuth in 2002.

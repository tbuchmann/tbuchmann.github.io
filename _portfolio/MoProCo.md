Description
-----

The MoProCo approach (Modeling, Prompting, Coding) represents a novel paradigm in software development that flexibly combines the three development strategies of modeling, AI-supported prompting, and classic manual coding. The aim is to provide developers with a multi-paradigmatic development process that leverages both the strengths of established modeling techniques and the possibilities of modern generative AI, while maintaining the precision of manual implementation.

At the heart of MoProCo is the idea of thinking about software development in terms of models: technical structures and requirements are first captured in models, which serve as the starting point for the further development process. On this basis, targeted prompts to generative AI systems can automatically generate code artifacts that implement or extend the models. Where necessary, this process is supplemented by manual coding, for example for fine-tuning, optimization, or integration. Crucially, MoProCo leaves the choice open: depending on the context, expertise, and tools, the development focus can be more on modeling, prompting, or classic implementation.

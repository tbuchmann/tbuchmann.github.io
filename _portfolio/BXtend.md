Description
-----

Model transformations constitute the core essence of model-driven software development (MDSD) â€“ a software 
engineering discipline, which gained more and more attention during the last decade. While technology for 
unidirectional batch transformations seems to be fairly well developed, tool support for bidirectional and 
incremental transformations is still restricted. Results obtained with case studies carried out with popular 
bidirectional approaches motivated us to set up our own light-weight framework for bidirectional and incremental 
model transformations based on the Xtend programming language. Our approach provides several advantages, as it 
reduces the cognitive complexity for transformation developers, and allows for a greater flexibility in 
transformation specifications by providing procedural language constructs. In addition, it provides a higher 
expressive power and allows for compact specifications at the same time.

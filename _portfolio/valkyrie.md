Description
-----

Valkyrie is a uml-based tool supporting model-driven software development in Eclipse. What makes it so special is that Valkyrie itself was developed in a purely model-driven way exploiting the full range of the Eclipse EMF ecosystem. Currently Valkyrie supports the most important UML diagram types, like
- Package diagrams
- Class diagrams
- Use Case diagrams
- Activity diagrams
- Statecharts
- Object diagrams

The provided diagrams allow for an agile model-driven workflow starting with requirements, design and implementation. Furthermore, a code generator is provided which currently produces Java source code from UML class diagrams and statecharts.

Furthermore, an experimental plugin exists, which allows for describing method bodies using the Action Language for Foundational UML.
